    <string name="home_1">At the Government announcement of the National Lockdown we realised we were in a desperate situation with over 350 dogs at the Farm and no way to feed them or care for them without our usual visitors or funds.</string>
    <string name="home_2">Our lockdown foster program was the first in our history and by March 26th over 200 dogs left the farm to go to their foster homes. With the addition of new litters, new rescues and pregnant mommies, that number quickly grew to approximately 275 dogs and puppies in foster care.</string>
    <string name="home_3">Since late March a little over 150 dogs that were in foster care have been adopted, half of those were young dogs or puppies but 50 % were mature adults dogs and 10 % were dogs with medical and behavioral issues.</string>
    <string name="home_4">That means that 77 dogs that would normally never have had a chance at the Farm, have found a home due to having been in Foster care. That is huge and we are immensely grateful to our fosters and adopters alike. We still have about 125 dogs in foster care, 25 of those are puppies that will or have already been adopted. Out of the 100 remaining dogs about half are potential foster fails, have applications or are with fosters that can keep them indefinitely.</string>
    <string name="home_5">All in all this has been a huge success and we would like to thank all of you for making this happen. Please join our Fallen Angels Lockdown Fosters Facebook page if you would like to follow our foster dogs and their amazing journeys.</string>
    <string name="home_6">For most of them, their story has just begun!</string>

    <string name="miss_2">Our main mission is to save and improve the living conditions of animals in their immediate surroundings, while maintaining their rehabilitation. This may involve re-homing animals who are unwanted, unloved or lost (mostly focusing on township animals, but not limited to). Ultimately the rehabilitation of animals will involve children, which will then act as therapy for both the children and the animals.</string>
